# Problem 1
def mean1(numbers: list[int | float]):
    """Write a function called ’mean1’ that takes a list as an input and returns the
    mean of the entries of that list. Add a docstring to this function that explains
    what it does, and veryfy that you can run ’help(mean1)’ in the VSCode interactive
    window or your code after defining it."""
